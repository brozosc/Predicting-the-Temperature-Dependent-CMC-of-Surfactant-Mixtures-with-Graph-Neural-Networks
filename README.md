# Predicting the Temperature-Dependent CMC of Surfactant Mixtures with Graph Neural Networks
This is the source code for the paper: [Predicting the Temperature-Dependent CMC of Surfactant Mixtures with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02224)

# Repo structure 

This repository is organized in two parts; one for the weighted-sum GNN model (ws_gnn) and one for the mixture-graph GNN model (mg_gnn). The implementation of the GNN models is given in each folder. 

# Data 

The data sets for 2 of the 4 test sets for binary mixtures and the 6 ternary mixtures are provided as open-source, along with the model predictions. The excel files can be found in the corresponding subfolders, e.g., ws_gnn/split_type_2/sub-test set_1/Test_set.xlsx
